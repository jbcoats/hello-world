# hello-world
This is my first github repository
My name is Jesse Brent Coats and Igo by 'Brent.' I have extensive professional programming experience and am currently enrolled at Seattle Central Colloge in a Programming certificate program.  I hope to re-enter the job market later this year and ideally, work for a company such as Amazon or Google (Alphabet).
